# CSGO Map

This project is built for CSGO player (including me... XD) that unfamiliar with CSGO competitive map. While play CSGO competitive, I often forget what it ll call in that place, so I made this app for myself. (it can help me when I play CSGO hehe...) The entire project is written by kotlin.
